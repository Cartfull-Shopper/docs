In the world of e-commerce, one of the best opportunities lies with customers who almost
made a purchase. These individuals have expressed a genuine interest in your product or
service, making them prime candidates for conversion. 

For BigCommerce stores, you now have a tool to help you monitor and reach out to customers
who abandoned their carts.

In this blog post, we'll explore the art of reaching out to potential customers who almost
bought something, why it's important, and how to do it effectively.

## Why it Matters

#### Abandoned Carts are Missed Opportunities. 

According to statistics, the average cart
abandonment rate for e-commerce sites is around 70%. This means that a substantial number
of potential customers are ready to make a purchase but abandon their shopping carts for
various reasons. Reaching out to these individuals can significantly boost your sales.

#### Customer Retention

Engaging with almost-buyers is an excellent way to build and maintain customer
relationships. By demonstrating your commitment to their satisfaction, you enhance the
chances of turning them into loyal, repeat customers.

#### Learning from Customer Behavior

When you reach out to potential customers who abandoned their carts, you can gain insights
into what might be preventing them from making a purchase. This information can help you
refine your website, product offerings, and overall customer experience.

## How to Reach Out Effectively

#### Timing is Everything

Contact potential customers promptly after they've abandoned their carts. The longer you
wait, the less likely they are to return and complete the purchase.  Implement automated
email or SMS sequences to remind them of their abandoned cart, ideally within 1-2 hours.

#### Personalized Messages

Craft personalized messages that remind the customer of the items left behind. Highlight
the benefits of the products, and consider offering an incentive, such as a discount or
free shipping, to sweeten the deal. Cartfull Shopper can help you understand what is in
the cart they abandoned and when they abandoned it.

If time is an issue, you can craft a message around a specific product instead of a
specific customer. With Cartfull Shopper, you can search abandoned carts by product and
download a list of emails from there.

#### Simplify the Checkout Process

If possible, address any issues that may have caused the abandonment in the first place.
Simplify the checkout process, offer multiple payment options, and ensure that the website
is mobile-friendly to make it as easy as possible for customers to complete their
purchases.

#### Customer Support

Provide easy access to customer support. Include a clear call-to-action in your follow-up
messages that encourages customers to reach out if they have any questions or concerns. A
quick and helpful response can often make the difference.

#### A/B Testing

Regularly test your outreach messages to see what works best. Experiment with different
subject lines, email content, and incentives. By analyzing the results, you can
continually improve your outreach strategy.

Use the Insights tool provided by Cartfull Shopper to check your abandonment and
conversion rates. These are useful for checking if your messaging is working and you're
converting carts to orders.

#### Multichannel Approach

Consider reaching out through multiple channels, including email, SMS, and even social
media. Some customers may prefer one channel over another, so offering options can
increase your chances of re-engagement.

#### Respect Privacy and Consent

Always ensure that your outreach efforts are compliant with
privacy laws and that you have the customer's consent to contact them. This builds trust
and reduces the likelihood of spam complaints.

## Conclusion

Reaching out to customers who almost bought something is a valuable strategy for
increasing sales and building lasting customer relationships. By implementing timely,
personalized, and customer-centric outreach efforts, you can turn potential abandonments
into conversions and create a more robust and loyal customer base. So, seize the
opportunity and make the most of those almost-made sales!
