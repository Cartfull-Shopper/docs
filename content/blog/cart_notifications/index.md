We at Cartfull Shopper are excited to announce our newest feature: cart notifications!
This is one of our most powerful features to date. You are now enabled to set up custom
notifications so you can be alerted whenever a cart meets whatever criteria you specify in
your notification.

Here are some examples of the kinds of notifications you can set up:
- A cart exceeds a total value of $500 or more.
- A cart is abandoned with a value of $100 or more.
- A cart switches from being a guest
- A cart with a specific product is abandoned
- A specific customer creates a cart
- Carts are abandoned 5 times within a 1 hour period
- A cart goes from abandoned to active
- A specific product is removed from a cart

You can create notifications specific to your store's needs. Receiving these notifications
allows you to take action right away. Perhaps you want to make sure a valuable cart gets
converted, so you can reach out to chat with the customer right away. Or maybe you're
doing some product testing and need to know how successful the new product is (or the
marketing for your product).

Or maybe you have certain products that need a little more help selling. When you find out
a cart has that product, you can help your customer by pointing them to customer reviews
about it or documentation you may have. 

Whatever the action is you need to take - the sooner you take it, the more likely you have
a cart purchase. Cartfull Shopper is now set up to help you take that immediate action.

Read more about how to set up notifications here in [our
documentation](/docs/guides/how-to-work-with-cart-nofitications/).
