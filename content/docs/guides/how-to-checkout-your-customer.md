If increasing the number of steps lowers your conversion rate - then it making fewer steps
will increase your conversion rate.

With Cartfull Shopper you can find and checkout carts for any customers who you know their
contact information or they have provided it to your store. The two most important factors
in checking out are:
- The billing address
- The shipping address

Both are required in order to complete a purchase. Both are made available to you in Cartfull
Shopper via simple forms. If the customer already has their contact information added to your store,
then you could checkout for them in a couple of steps. Below are a gifs that show the
overall process.

### Multiple Consignments
You may also have a more complicated checkout that requires multiple address and assigning
items in that cart to those multiple addresses. Cartfull Shopper can help there too!

### Applying Discounts and Coupons
What is also extremely beneficial to you as a store owner is being able to give a specific
customer a discount or a coupon. Imagine you have an abandoned cart, but they may be
willing to purchase that cart if you can lower the price a bit. Find the cart and lower
the price and you're that much closer to closing a sale.
