An important part of any cart monitoring tool is being able to find specific carts. You
need powerful filtering tools to help you assess your current carts and navigate to any
that may need help. You have a plethora of options to choose from with Cartfull Shopper,
including:
- Status (abandoned, active, stale, etc)
- Date cart was created or moved to a different status
- Customers
- Product
- Cart ID itself

You can also sort by several options to place your most pertinent carts at the top.

When searching by customers/products or cart IDs, you may add several at once. Filter by
multiple customers who have certain products in their cart, or find all carts that contain
one of several different products.

### Now that you've found your cart(s)

To help with your customers, you can modify their carts by:
- adding items
- taking away items
- or changing the quantity of any items currently in the cart

This can help prepare a customer to checkout and therefore can help in converting
customers.

It's also very easy for you to modify a cart. Simply click on the delete, edit or add item
links. You'll always be asked to confirm the action you want to take. Your cart will be
updated once the action has been updated and reflected in your store.
