### Why should you know what your most ordered products are?

For many reasons:
1. So you can duplicate their success across your other products. Did you market it
   differently? Do you have interactive videos showcasing it?
2. So you can be sure to stay stocked up. You'll know to watch inventory on these
   particular products.
3. Understand your customers better. What kind of customers are you attracting to your
   store? How can you market to more of them?


### Most Abandoned Products?

You can also find your products abandoned the most. Navigate to Abandoned Insights and
select your preferred date range. Look for "Most Abandoned Products". This may tell you
- what products may be overpriced. Customers look to buy them but are put off by the price
- the products may have too many negative reviews. Customers learn more about the product
  and decide not to buy it.

Whatever the case, this knowledge tells you what products to focus on. You can either find
ways to improve the product (like making the quality better or lowering the price) OR you
may decide it's not a product worth having in the store. This can save you on costs for
managing that product.
