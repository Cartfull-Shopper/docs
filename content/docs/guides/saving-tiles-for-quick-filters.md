While monitoring carts in your store, you may find that you repeat the same filters. You
can create a tile to have it appear on your home dashboard page - and that tile will have
your favorite filters saved. This helps you save time to access what is important to you.

To save a tile
- go to Cart Activity
- select the filters you want
- click the green "Save Filters as Tile" button
- Name the filter and click "Create"

Here are some examples of tiles you can create:
- Highest value carts in the last week
- Most recent abandoned carts
- Carts that contain a product that you are trying to monitor
- Most recent carts that have been ordered
